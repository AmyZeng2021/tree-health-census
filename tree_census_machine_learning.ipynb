    "The goal of building our machine learning model is to correctly predict a tree's health based on independent variables. We are classifying categorical variables. They are nominal, meaning that they do not have any intrinsic order to them, unlike ordinal variables. To measure our model's success, we are relying on a [classification report](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html), which shows the main classification metrics such as precision, recall, and f1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our algorithms of choice are: [LogisticRegression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html), [KNeighborsClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html), [DecisionTreeClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html), [RandomForestClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html), and [Gaussian Naive Bayes](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html#gaussian-naive-bayes). To prepare our data, we separate our target variable, y or tree health, from the independent variables, X. Next, we split X and y into training and test sets by a percentage. In our case, we are training with 75% of our data and testing with the remaining 25% percent. After splitting, we are ready to begin testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that due to the heavily imbalanced group representation of our data, we are incorporating under sampling and over sampling methods in an effort to improve our precision and recall scores to find the best possible model. There are two separate notebooks for under and over sampling techniques due to the number of methods used and the length of the notebooks."
