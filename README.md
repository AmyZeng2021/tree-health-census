# Modeling the Health of NYC Trees Using the 2015 Tree Census

Trees are an essential part of New York City. There are trees planted on every sidewalk in each borough, and the famous Central Park is home to over 20,000 trees. Keeping track of them is hard work and takes a lot of time and energy. Which is why every year, NYC Parks & Rec asks volunteers to go and document the living conditions of the city’s trees to create a census. This census is used to keep track of the city's trees (stump and living) and state their conditions and surroundings.

NYC trees provide a plethora of benefits as well as add an aesthetic value to the city’s parks and streets. Trees help reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality, provide shade, lower air temperatures, reduce stormwater runoffs, and increase home values. They cover approximately a quarter of NYC and so it's understandable that the city invests in maintaining the well-being of these trees. However, over time, due to negligence and a variety of factors, a tree's health can decline and eventually, the tree is reduced to a stump (keeping a dead tree up is dangerous as it is susceptible to lightning and a fire hazard).

Since NYC spends millions every year to keep the city green, it’s important to have a way of monitoring the trees so that they can continue to flourish and thrive. This project aims to create a model that predicts whether or not a tree is in need of attention due to poor health. The data comes from the [2015 Street Tree Census from NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh).
