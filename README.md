# Capstone Project: 2015 Tree Census

The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning model that predicts the health of a tree based on a variety of factors, such as:
- location
- tree diameter (cm)
- location in relation to the curb
- tree type
- stewardship
- guardship
- sidewalk condition
- root condition
- trunk condition
- branch condition

Trees are an essential part of New York City. They provide shade, improve air quality, reduce flooding and improve water quality, and help increase property value in the city.
